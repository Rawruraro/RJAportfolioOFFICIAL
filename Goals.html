    <h1>Our Group's Goals</h1> 
    <p>As we continue to grow and learn, we do our best to balance school and leisure, making sure we make the most of what we have. We may not have much, but we have our dreams and our passions. We aim to create an RFID Attendance Checker that will access the name and photo of the person tapping their card on the machine. Why are we passionate about this? Money.</p>
    <p>Aside from that, we want to make games together. A game that tells a touching story and is also quite enjoyable. Or a game that brings people together. We simply want to have fun!</p>
